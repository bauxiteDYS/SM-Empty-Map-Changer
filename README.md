# SM-NT-Empty-Map-Changer.Restart
Sourcemod plugin for Neotokyo that changes to the nextmap when server is empty and will attempt to restart after approx 16 hours if empty.
Plugin will check if the player count is 1 or less (includes bots and stv), every 39 minutes and change map if it is, and then restart after 24 checks, about 16 hours.
