# SM-NT-Empty-Map-Changer.TimedRestart
Sourcemod plugin for Neotokyo that changes to the nextmap when server is empty and will attempt to restart around the scheduled time if empty.
Plugin will check if the player count is 1 or less (includes bots and stv), every 39 minutes and change map if it is, or restart around scheduled time.
